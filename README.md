# node-js-mixfetch

easy to set up instructions:

1. yarn install 
2. yarn start
3. navigate in your browser to http://localhost:3000
4. input any url that returns a json data (disclosure, this hasn't been battled tested, so if you put in an endpoint that doesn't return json data, that's a you problem)

see the output on your screen :)

here are some fun endpoints:
- https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/random.json?language=en
- https://validator.nymtech.net/api/v1/mixnodes
- https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/search?query=nym
