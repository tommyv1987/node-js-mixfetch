# node-js-mixfetch

easy to set up instructions:

1. yarn install 
2. yarn start
3. navigate in your browser to http://localhost:3000
4. input any url that returns json data (disclosure: this hasn't been battle tested, so if you put in an endpoint that doesn't return json data, that's your problem)

(See the output on your screen.)

Here are some fun endpoints:
- https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/random.json?language=en
- https://validator.nymtech.net/api/v1/mixnodes
- https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/search?query=nym
